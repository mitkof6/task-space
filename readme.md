Description
---

This project implements constraint and task space projection for OpenSim v4.0.
The purpose is to design well documented, very simple and light-weighted API
where the user can plan a movement in task space and perform simulations in a
mixed dynamics manner. A mixed dynamics scheme is a combination of an inverse
dynamics controller (equations of motion in task space) that feds a forward
dynamics module.

The underlying task space controller supports task prioritization [1] and
constraint modeling [2-3]. As the constraints are implicitly accounted in the
inverse dynamics model this implementation is able to simulate accurately
models that use constraints. Examples include: absolute (Cartesian)
coordinates, closed kinematics chains and complex joint configurations (e.g.
shoulder, knee) [4].

Examples can be found in the src/taskspace/examples folder.

- ExampleTaskBasedControl.cpp: a minimum working example of controlling a
  single body in task space

- ExampleAbsoluteCoordinates.cpp: a two body model built using absolute
  coordinates and constraints for modeling the joint restrictions, with a
  position planning controller (task space) of the end-effector body; a
  selection matrix has been used to model under-actuation 

- ExampleClosedKinematicChain.cpp: three bodies are arranged in a closed
  kinematic chain topology and the planning is performed by defining the
  orientation of one of the bodies in task space

- ExampleArm26.cpp: a musculoskeletal model that is controlled by multiple
  prioritized tasks where the muscle excitation that track the task goals are
  estimated using Task Space Computed Muscle Control [5]

TODO

This project is a re-implementation of
[github](https://github.com/mitkof6/opensim-task-space) so some features are
still missing.

- Task Space Dynamic Inverse Kinematics [5]

- Implement test cases
