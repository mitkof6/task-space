	# We prefer using MathJax locally, but we have to download it first.

	# The zip can be thrown away, but the 150 mb MathJax directory must stay
	# with the Doxygen documentation.

	# back onto LaTeX. If the user has neither MathJax *or* LaTeX, we fall back
	# on using MathJax from the internet instead of downloading it.
